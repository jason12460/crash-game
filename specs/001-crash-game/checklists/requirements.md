## Notes

**All Validation Items Passed** âœ…

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. **FR-009**: Cash-out timing - resolved with server timestamp comparison (cash-out succeeds if request before crash)
2. **FR-015**: Betting constraints - resolved as $1.00 minimum, $1000.00 maximum, 2 decimal precision

**Specification Status**: READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, validated, and ready to proceed to the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).
